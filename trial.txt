This is my first repo
I will trian on this repo 
repo trial
hey hey repo
this is the first edit
the edit will be shown in the history
this is the second version of the trial file 
Github is an online version control system, and that means it can help us to manage different versions of our project.
we can make a repository ["folder"], make many versions ["copys"] of that folder, and we can move these changes to the main folder as we do in this file.
Github keep track of our change, allow the team to work on the same file at the same time and every member of the team work with a different branch.
these changes will just occur on this branch "trial second version" so i can keeb my "main" branch as it is without changes and just make changes on this branch.
when we make a new branch fron the main branch it's like we make a copy of the folder so we can chnge on it without messing with the main branch.
if we are satisfied about the changes we made on the second branch, we can commit ["transfer"] these changes to the main branch ["folder"].
We can make fork ["copy"] of the folder but it works different of than branch, it make a copy of the entire project, we often do that if we don't want 
our branches to mix together and make a mess or if we decided to split up our project in a certian point for and they will be to projects with tow different features
for EX when we make a software but we will split it in some point and one version will be on "ios" and the other will be on "Apk".
